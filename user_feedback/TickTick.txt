1.Despite reporting issues and downloading the updated TickTick app, my powerful phone still experiences frequent freezing and lagging when I use the app. As a premium user, the persisting problems make me reluctant to continue using the app, and uninstallation seems inevitable due to its sluggish performance. It's very sad!
2.FFS stop swapping the Complete and Snooze buttons in notification reminders after every new update.
3.I posted a one-star review a year ago and am now updating it & it's still one star. Tick Tick will not sync between my laptop and my computer. This is crucial for the work I do and it's beyond frustrating. Tick Tick's online "help center" is a joke. 11-6-23 they just updated the app, and it still doesn't sync with the laptop. Good work! And I have sent the developers at least three "tickets" through the app and have never gotten any response.
4.Worst update ever! Do developers stop and think about the people that are using the app before they change things? Why swap the completed and the snooze button and change the pop-up all around? Before I didn't even have to look at it to snooze it. It's basically just muscle memory at this point, been using it for so many years. Now since the update I have inadvertently hit complete on dozens of alerts I was trying to snooze. I've had to redo them all several times. What a complete hassle.
5.Moved the location of the complete button super annoying, not user friendly
6.Something's going on with the popup messages with "Complete" and "Snooze" buttons - they keep swapping places which makes UX super frustrating, so many times I've "completed" instead of snoozing!
7.Hate the latest update. Why did you have to swap positions of snooze and complete buttons in the notifications? I had developed the muscle memory for the complete button. Now I keep pressing the snooze button insted of complete 🤬
8.Edit: I've rolled back to a previous version. V7.0 looks really nice, but you've broken the app (subtasks flying left and right, randomly deleted). Took less than 5 minutes for 7.0 to turn my perfect little schedule into a beautiful little Picasso. Please, for the future: Your ONE role, before anything else, as a productivity app is to be consistently reliable. Not sexy, etc. All else great, if number ONE is in place. So 🙏 don't test on your users. You're no video game. Test, test, then launch
9.I thought this would be the replacement for Wunderlist, but no, it's complicated and unintuitive... they want you to sign up and sign in when all you want to do is just compile a list... pencil and paper is much more effective.
10.App seemed promising and was planning to buy subscription.. And then I discovered that buying it through their website is $35.99 for an annual subscription, but from the app, it would cost me $46.74 for a year...
11.Oh noooo. Not another brand new GUI. Now it means waiting as long as it works and then decide to keep it or switch to something new.
12.When it works, it might be the best reminder app, but it freezes my phone 20-30 times a day, for upwards of 2-3 minutes, during which you can't use your phone at all. You might have an app you are using (like YouTube) that suddenly can't be stopped (or the volume turned down) while TickTick freezes the phone's user interface.
13.TickTick is a great service, but the app version gets a 1 star because of it's forced daily notifications. Every day it'll blast an alarm at 9am for literally no reason, and this setting somehow overrides your phone notification settings. So even if you disable the app from alerting you it'll still bypass it and alert you anyways. The only way to disable this is through the app, which TickTick never tells you and the alarms hide which app is the cause.
14.Used to like this app. I was active with feedback for bugs too. Then they started adding in awful features, with no option to turn them back off. The latest update, you can't even reorder your tasks anymore. You can drag them, but they just flick back to original position every time. This is because the update forced us to have the tasks sorted by time. Stupid garbage idea you forced on us there. Deleting it now
15.Watch notification does not work on samsung devices, why? I have been premium subscriber since 3 years ago and I hope you could fix it, this kind of failures it has last a lot
16.It is good that this app is feature rich but I hate its UI. One of the worst UIs if we compare it with other apps in this segment.
17.I love my desktop app, but the Android app never works -- it either won't open my task list at all, or once it does, it freezes as soon as it does and I can't scroll, check off, or create new tasks. Play Store says that the app is up-to-date, and my phone OS is up-to-date as well.
18.I really love the design and layout of this app but unfortunately the Google Calendar integration isn't very reliable when compared with other apps. For example, if I change the time of something on my calendar it just duplicates the event with the new time in the app and if I delete an event it still shows up most of the time. I've stuck around for over a year hoping it would improve but it doesn't and support often doesn't even respond.
19.1st I want to say, I love this app, I'm a subscriber and have been using for 3 years now. But it really needs to be updated for bugs and issues like that. When I make a checklist, the list ends up deleting items itself, or doesn't update the changes, or the app just crashes. I have the latest version of android. I loved this app and would hate to have to cancel my paid subscription and look for another app, but there are so many bugs and glitches in it that need attention.
20.Not recommended. Looks promising at first but search function is broken, among other things. Totally useless. Contacting support is a pain because they only reply when they want to, and they only pick the issues they want to fix. Not something you'd expect for a paid subscription service. So if you have a lot of notes, don't expect the search function to work for you. Find another better app.
2 звезды:
1.They swapped the Snooze and Complete button, and my muscle memory is not adjusting. There is no way to swap these back. I normally really like this app, even with the occasional giant "please pay for premium" pop ups, but the latest update has introduced a random button swap for seemingly no reason and with no way to undo or swap back. This feels so ridiculously minor to complain about and yet it's affected my workflow enough that I may as well learn to use a different app.
2.This is a good app and it's premium subscription is helpful for me. However, the main page as well as it's widgets show today's overdue tasks in blue rather than in red. If a task is overdue by 2hrs, then that should be shown in overdue list and not today list. Same with widgets, there should be another filter to display only overdue tasks even if they are only overdue by 2hrs and future tasks should not get displayed in the list. Hence I am reducing the number of stars in my review.
3.Needs lot of improvents UX wise 1. If the all the lists are only accessible from the menu which only shows up in the first tab why not make that on the bottom bar like evernote, todoist, google tasks, etc 2. Also, Note editor is not good..it is buggy. Note flickers when scrolling Plus, that shortcut to make note bold, italics etc are very annoying. Copying the note to google docs is so hard because of those "*" and "#" which also get copied and the format also changes
4.The apps concept is good but there are much room to be improved. The apps have many bugs such as reminder sometimes not working, notification disappears when the focus time is finished and always not syncing within different device using same account. The apps crash when add time to the record. When using Google maps, the apps notification block the map although I have disabled the notification of this app. Not worth to purchase the service.
5.I really liked a lot of the features but I couldn't get the focus timers on my laptop to play a start and stop sound so I kept working through my break. I went in and gave notification permissions as was suggested. And when I went to cancel there was no place to do so, not even in the play store. But in PayPal it was listed as an active recurring payment.
6.Something this app is doing is hijacking the alarm notification tray tile in Android 13. It should open the Clock app but it instead opens a TickTick Habit.
7.To be honest it is a great app. All of the features are great. Very helpful. But the reason I give the 2 star is that it only allow me to make 5/6 list!! I khow you will tell me give the premium. But I will tell that you should at least give some flexibility in this place. If i can't make some of the lists then why should i use this application!!
8.It's a great app with tons of features, however the support just stopped answering my questions and I can't use it on Android (Pixel) anymore. When I try to add a task, after writing some characters, the app suddenly minimizes itself and don't save anything. So sad. I'm a premium anual user, but I'm moving to another app...
9.At first it seemed good. I paid a month subscription to try out some of the premium features. The habit tracker is annoying. I'll tick off that I completed one of my habits for the day and the app will still send me 1-3 notifications to complete the habit. Not something I would expect from a paid app. I suggest you add some piece of code that tells the app not to notify the user when they have ticked off their goal.
10.I paid for the annual membership after trying the free version for a few days because I really wanted it to work, but after trying to use premium for a few days, I realized that this program was packed with features but has an absolutely unintuitive interface. I've tried using it here and there, but it's just frustrating and anxiety inducing. I advise using and loving the free version for at least a month before committing to membership.
11.App is OK. I use it for some time already. Recently I have discovered Duckduckgo APP Tracking Protection.. And then I discovered how much data TickTick is sending out without my consent. It's contacting Google Firebase and also Bugsnag company. YES. I know it's probably "aggregated anonymous usage data" that "helps you to find bugs and optimize your marketing stuff". Nevertheless I think users should have some control: like "help us improve" setting which is common in other apps.
12.Pros: it has a ton of fancy features. Cons: it has a ton of fancy features. Too many unnecessary stuff. I paid for subscription to try calendar. It's nice. However, setting a task attributes is a frustrating process since they put so many stuff in the menu. It's like instead of manging tasks alone, now you have to manage the app also. They use their web app for subscription to cause you some obstacle to not unsubscribe the service Dear productivity seekers, I would recommend to try Focus To Do.
13.Used to be great, but so many features are locked behind a paywall it's no longer worth it. I don't mind paying a one-off fee for an app, but a subscription of $30 a year to maintain a to-do list app is highway robbery. I can't even see a calendar view without paying. Not to mention it can be fiddly as hell, and I'm a UX designer... I'm uninstalling.
14.So greedy app, it only wants you to pay,if you wouldn't pay you won't be able to use the app, there's only 5 habits you can set in the app or buy the premium version to set 6, additional to the biggest problem which's the price thet you should pay it is so expensive, also no any kind of discounts for students, all these problems is terrible, greedy, and make the app useless, and you can't use most content in the app,i'm so frustrated about the app and I'm really thinking to permanently delete it
15.About 8 years ago, I was delighted to find a to-do/task list that I could sync across various devices, which provided sensible options for recurring tasks and reminders for those tasks, and which displayed upcoming items in due-date order. That was TickTick. But that was then; this is now. The last Android update made TickTick too complex. It's trying to do far more than I want or need. Worse, it now forces me to log in every time I open the app on my phone -- but it doesn't recognize LastPass.
16.Max of 5 habits on free version. My primary goal is to transfer all of my daily (morning, noon, evening), weekly, biweekly, monthly tasks/habits from another app. Not for me.
17.Great task manager. Terrible privacy, security & support. The app auto calls and resolves URLs, with no way to control or prevent it. Want to use the app at work? Better hope work is okay with every link you put in TickTick, like your job interview, being loaded from your work network. Insecure design. Impossible to get anyone at the company to discuss. As a paying customer-still no support.
18.I can no longer manually sort my tasks for any given day. This is a deal breaker for me as I use planners to sort my jumbled thoughts. Not being able to sort the tasks keeps them jumbled. Will be looking for another planner app. Otherwise, I absolutely loved this app
19.No doubt the app is good but one has to press a lot of buttons to add/edit a task, for e.g., selecting date/time, recurrence, list etc. It is too much of playing around with the buttons. Besides, when I mark the task as done, my phone freezes for a few seconds. And for the premium, the quick add ball is not showing on the lock screen. I reported these two issues to the developer but they never looked into it. I am now reverting back to Life Reminders which I had purchased long back.
20.It's a great to-do app, I'll give you that. It has the Eisenhower matrix and a built in calendar. But apparently, it won't let me sign in due to "oops, a network problem" or "authorization failed". Please fix this.
3 звезды:
1.Why on earth would you randomly change the "snooze" "complete" task buttons in latest update. AND.... half the time when the reminder pops up it's switched back! 😳 I do NOT like this change. I have LOVED LOVED LOVED this app! It has completely supported my crazy life as a mom of multiple special needs kiddos & all the tasks I need to remember to do for them, myself & our household. But PLEASE change back the dang buttons. Muscle memory causes me to click the wrong button too often! 🤦‍♀️
2.Overall, the app is fine and works for me. However with the latest version, they changed the order of the "Snooze" and "Complete" buttons in the notification. For anyone like myself who has used the app for years, this results in many times accidentally clicking the wrong one. This change adds no value at all but will frustrate any users who have previously used these notification action buttons!
3.The app is pretty good. I downloaded it about 3 weeks ago and tried out the premium version because I NEED a monthly calendar view of my to-do items. (I schedule up to 2 weeks out, so a 7-day view just doesn't cut it.) I was planning on continuing to use it periodically whenever I ended up having a busy month, but sometime in the last 3 weeks, the price jumped from about $2.79 a month to $3.99. That's too much just for a monthly calendar view and not needing the rest of the premium features.
4.Two things let down this app. The first is that it would be useful to include the two day rule when it comes to habits. Since I only use it for the habit widget and Eisenhower matrix I cannot justify a subsciption just to be able to add a few more habits. I hope the devs will allow a few more for free or the option to pay a small, one-off fee for extra slots. It is a great app and I don't want to replace it.
5.Acorss device real time sync is buggy. Already tracked time isn't showing up accurately across different devices. I know the feature is brand new so I guess it will take some time to polish it. Just leaving this review here so that the developer see's the issue. Edit: Experience is way worse than I had anticipated. Certain recorded focus entries on mobile are not showing up on PC as well as Android tablet. Sometimes entries just appear and then disappear on their own. Need a quick update.
6.update: I've been trying to check off habit items like take a walk, etc but some of them don't save no matter how many times I check it off, it just undoes my check. Happens every time with Take a Walk, even though I even made a new one manually. Same with latest version. Also, the price is too high.
7.This app is good. It is simple and intuitive. The Eisenhower Matrix, pomodoro timer just greatness. But... Why can't I make a Kanban board from a filtered list? This has been crazy making. Okay...I can't, so I thought I'd just have to have one massive list and filter it. Nope! No filter option. So, essentially, the Kanban board is useless. Ugh! Also, I wish you could sort/filter by task duration/poms and see the total duration for each list. If I could do these things this app would be magical!!
8.Recliner reliability has improved but still malfunctions every month or so. The auto reminder detection is why I haven't jumped ship, but even that needs some major upgrades like - "5 june 6pm" doesn't recognize 6pm, I have to put two spaces after june to get it work which is dumb. Also there should be support for phrases like "in one hour / day / week" etc.
9.I give up. Setting durations for tasks is very frustrating. Selecting Duration > Time > Advanced seems straight forward enough, but the selected times just don't seem to stick! The app gets confused and a 'morning routine' that you scheduled from 07:30 - 08:15 keeps getting saved as 00:00 from the previous day to 08:15 that morning. Something with the time/date functionally is out of whack. I love this app otherwise, though.
10.Search function behave abnormally when you put space in to the task that you serched on ( after the search results ).. Other user also reported the same thing.please fix that.
11.I've been using Tick Tick since 2017, it's been amazing. But what happened with the last update? It messed up all of my sorting in the daily view, now everything is in jumbled order that doesn't make sense. I used to order things by priority (not custom) so I could accomplish my tasks, but it's all unsorted. It looks correct in the overall task view but daily view is messed up. Have tried everything, can't figure out how to make it work. Please return it to the way it's been for 6 years!
12.This app is perfect in a lot of ways. It has a lot of flexibility in organizing and categorizing and includes powerful features often only seen in more expensive apps. What drives me crazy, is how broken the Google Assistant experience is. Essentially anytime I've ever want to use Google Assistant with it, it has been a headache... I've had to authorize it again and again and even then, 9 out of 10 times, it just doesn't work.
13.When trying to enter multiple events, they don't appear until I restart my phone. I want to cancel premium. The app says to do this in the Play Store, but there is no option to do so.
14.Location support for tasks and notes is poor. Google calendar integration is not importing event colors, like for example Evernote does. Ticktick integration into gcal has extremely long sync times. The Linux app has weirdly high CPU usage, alternatively an Android app for chrome os does not exist. The developer does not really respond to feedback because it's a Chinese company focusing mainly on the original Chinese version of the app.
15.It seems like a real good app, and in the end I was choosing between this and another app. I ended up choosing other one for four reasons: 1) To add subtasks to a. task, I have to click 3 times though different screens. Too much, I do it often. 2) Can't cancel a single instance of a recurring event without either deleting or completing previous incompleted instances, which is crucial 3) Can't past text into the deception field 4) Can't copy the event location address once inserted.
16.Have been happy about this app until a few months ago. The app no longer sync automatically. Every sync must be manual. And even that the sync doesn't always work. This is a huge problem if you use desktop and Phone back and forth. The sync used to be robust and seamless. Now it is half broken.
17.Missing some basic features, but overall good. Biggest flaw is lack of sorting or management of checked off items. When you mark eggs off your shopping list, you have to hunt through the checked items to find out again later, when an alphabetized list would make it so efficient. Our you just add eggs again to the point you eventually have eggs in the completed list 7 times. That problem alone is serious enough for me to drop 2 stars off. Fix that and I'd rate it a 5.
18.I really loved this app. By far the best productivity app in the market. I'm giving just 3 stars because of one major issue I'm facing. I am not getting notifications for my reminders consistently, even though I followed all the steps provided by the app. Team pls fix this issue because sending timely notifications is one of the most important feature when it comes to productivity.
19.It is extremely anoying that the long press to select multiple items randomly works. Otherwise app works great.
20.Looks promising, but I need a delete option directly on the task, not hidden in a menu. No I don't want to tick completed, I don't want the thought of a task completed taking up space somewhere. Deleted means done. Then the interface is a bit plain. Could do with some more spice.
4 звезды:
1.I liked the old update better! It feels slightly sluggish and slower than last time (not a huge difference though).
2.I love your update 🙌 Can you please add notes or checklist at habits?
3.Previously 5 stars, but I'm downgrading due to the unnecessary swap of the complete and snooze buttons. I have muscle memory for hitting complete and keep hitting snooze by accident every since this swap happened for no reason.
4.what is usefull in 7.0? i not find anything useless as a 4year of ticktick user & you guye Ui sucks can you work on it or not?
5.Been using TickTick for over a year now, overall very happy with all the features, look and UX. I've not had to use customer support or report any issues yet, so can't comment on that experience. It would be great if calendar could in future support dynamic sync to Microsoft Outlook (can add the calendar view but not add/edit events, as it does for Google Calendar).
6.The latest redesign has inexplicably flipped the snooze and complete buttons in the notifications. Why? I mean, one way isn't better than the other, but everyone that uses your app already has a muscle memory. I hate it.
7.I've been using this pgrm for some time and despite having some hickups in the beginning years ago. It seems to have turned out to be a pretty good pgrm .. a bit of a learning curve to it. But you get used to it.
8.Very Good app, will be better if– 1. Various colour for text, may help to quick seperation of tasks. 2. Bright colour & bold font for List name instead of a faint colour and thin font which is not legible. 3. A task repeated every month, say 17th of each month. After review on this month's 17th, I need to postpone it on 20th, by making change to it, all tasks get changed as on 20th instead of 17th. Add facility to change for only one month. This is posible with Google calendar. Good day !
9.Almost perfect. I just wish the "estimated duration" of a task could be set when creating it. For instance with the keyword "for" when followed my a number. Also, the "~" for quick addition to a project is to hard to reach on a mobile keyboard. I suggest giving us the option to change that. Other than that, TickTick has convinced this Todoist and Microsoft To Do veteran. :)
10.Pls add an option to move the undone tasks to the next day automatically. And an option to blur the background of the widget.
11.I have sent two concerns to you regarding the application locking up. You haven't even bothered to respond. I pay for this app and it is getting infuriating that when I open it the thing locks up on me. I suggest you do something about this problem or you're going to lose customer. I am lowering my rating down to one because you refuse to respond.
12.I've been using this app since a while. It's a great tool for productivity enhancement as I can list all my tasks datewise. This only problem I find is the alarm reminder feature doesn't work unless the app is opened. I missed to eat my medicines as I was relying on the alarm which didn't rang.
13.This app is awesome! But it didn't completely work for my brain. I liked being about to see my tasks in my calendar. That I could sort tasks into list. I mostly like the habits. I wish there was a crate your own habit. You basically just had to pick a template that matched the most and then alter it how you wanted to. It was really hard for my brain not to see the time blocks that I had to fill with the tasks.
14.I've been searching left and right for a good app to manage my ADHD, and so far it proves better than any other app I've tried. The option for a constant reminder is a MUST HAVE for stubborn people like me. The all around flexibility is incredibly accommodating. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the habits feature. My habits haven't been displaying properly. It will only display up to 3 of them, and anytime I try to add more they are seemingly non-existent.
15.It's a great app and fits my needs as a busy college student perfectly. My one issue is all the shortcuts when typing out a task. If I put that I need to take notes on chapter 2.2 it tries to set a reminder for 2am, which I have to manually delete. I've triggered shortcuts accidentally before and had to just delete and reword the entry because I couldn't figure out what or where it was. I wish there was an option to turn shortcuts off.
16.Like it, this app is great with premium, with a few existing inconvenience. But without premium it's just like the other regular app in which case Google Calendar is a better choice
17.Love it so far and bought premium, though I wish I didn't because I was hoping this could fully replace google calendar. But if I don't want my events to be a tick list, I have to import from Google calendar. I'll buy premium again if this is introduced (and the price is still the same).
18.Been using it for years, but in recent months new features have been very useful. Better looking ui, Gantt view, kanban, and better habit tracking. Keep up the good work. My only issues are regarding color contrast in the dark mode. It's a little too dark, with some shades almost blending together. Higher contrast should fix it.
19.This is an amazing app. I've used all kinds of productivity apps and before this I was in todolist + Google cal + notion workflow. Now 2 of them is replaced by just one. It's Tick tick + Notion workflow now. The UI might be a bit old but features are great. Hope the UI is improved soon. Habit tracker and pomo are a great addon which I otherwise would not have used. Now that everything is in one app, it's much smoother to be on track. Great work by the team.
20.I switched from todoist because of the better organisation of tasks, but the smart recognition of dates and times is far inferior (stuff like changing the time or date of a to-do by just writing it in teh title). Also I paid for premium to have my todoes sync to my calendar and other way around... The calendar items sync okish (some do, some don't) but the todos don't appear in my Google calendar. Rest seems good though. Little bit complex, but I think you get used to it
5 звезд:
1.BEST task manager. HIGHLY customizable. I'd be lost without it. (I've seen some complaints about the latest upgrade. I don't have a problem with it, AND "There's no constant but change.".)
2.I've been a loyal TickTick user for years. Over the last several months, my checklists will disappear. The main task is there, but every single check box for every single task is gone. Last time I submitted a ticket, they didn't know why it happened but suggested I upload a back up. Fine, except IT KEEPS HAPPENING. Doesn't matter what device I'm using. I've been singing your praises for years, but I can't trust an app that deletes my info repeatedly.
3.I think the dev team is doing a great job fixing bugs. Thank you! Changed to 5 stars
4.Everything is good. But you can make the calendar better. Because that's what I'm paying for. Mainly being able to find the tasks in its folders while adding them to calendar and better drag and drop and better breakdown of hours on calendar. Update: you did it faster than I expected. Awesome tick tick! +One feature thatd be super useful would be the ability to select and move multiple tasks to a later time in the day. Believe me it's such a basic thing no calendar does. Game changer in fact.
5.been using this app since 2017. And love it. Love the features being added and the features that are available. There are bugs and issues but it still has over a 98% value for me. Love it. 2023 still loving it.
6.I really enjoy my experience with Ticktick so far. I was looking for an app that would combine task management and habit tracking, and Ticktick is doing it perfectly. I like that it has an option of syncing only local calendars, so I don't have to worry about the safety of my personal data. Also love that it has a desktop app! Feature request: I would love it if I could interact with calendar events the same way I do with tasks - add descriptions and subtasks, mark as done or cancelled.
7.TickTick is really great. Tags, list filters, views like the Eisenhower matrix make it very easy to view my tasks at different levels of granularity (e.g. all to-do's for the day, versus work to-do's, versus all urgent items). I'm neurodivergent and the view that works best for me changes with my focus level. It's really nice to be able to adjust for that within a single app.
8.This is a beautiful design and well integrated app. Have so many features that works awesome at all aspects. Although it requires a little of practice and a learning curve, it totally worthy. It have everything that you need in the free version but I recommend buy it, because it's very inexpensive and a form to support the team behind. 😎
9.Ive tried a lot of organizing and to do apps and this is better than all of them. this is an honest opinion. Super 5 stars, can I give 20 stars? If you could for premium have a start button beside the task, and then record how long it takes, and then auto fill that task on the calendar where the time is indicated, I will subscribe to premium. So for the today window, youd have a start task to begin pomo (youll switch windows), and checkbox for when it's done.
10.Love this app!! It's exactly what I've spent years looking for! Einstein matrix, various displays and organizational methods for lists and task, calendars (you can import from personal, work, etc). Plus the habit tracker with an Pondo timer!!! The widgets are so fun, it makes me want to use it, thus I'm utilizing my time better, so it really is working.
11.tick tick far exceeds other task management apps - period. As with any powerful app you will not learn it in 5min but in 5min you can certainly, already be more productive. TickTick is regulalrly improved in what seems to be a user-focused manner vs a hidden 'corporate' agenda. Cost is reasonable if you go that route.
12.Overall, I love this app. It's easy to use and has a lot of features that allow me to organize all my tasks. The previous issue has been fixed with the newest update. Speaking of that update, I love it! The app looks and feels smoother. I like that it's now a pop-up instead of just pulling up the entire task page automatically because it's quicker and takes up less space on the screen.
13.So far, the redesign has been great. I think the added features are well implemented and the updated look is pleasing without being so dramatically different that it causes issues. I've been using the app off and on for a year or so. I'll stick with this app as long as it remains this consistent. Thanks to the developers!
14.Amazing. Great interface. This app can do anything you would need for simple or power users. It is great for a simple to do list personally and complex situations for work. The free version alone is very comprehensive. Slightly buggy but I have been using it for years and nothing major.
15.This is the to-do list manager that I have been looking for for the past 10 years. I've used everything from the built-in ones on my phones and computers, to Trello, and most recently Todoist. TickTick is very feature-rich and has a bit of a learning curve, but the user interface is well laid out intuitive, and the help and tutorials told me everything I need to know to get started. Edit: I found a small bug, and reported it through the app. It was fixed in the next patch release. 🙂
16.This is the one. Easy and intuitive. Simple and not over engineered, yet functional. Group task by high med low and no priority. Set reminders on a calendar, etc. I've been using it daily for years and absolutely love it. Sometimes I do get frustrated with the pomo timer, even with permission it sometime won't go off if the the screen is locked.
17.Great except I can't use it. Notifications on my Galaxy Watch 4 stopped working. Tried everything I can think of to check and fix. I am a computer person and know Android settings pretty well. My other apps that notify work fine on my watch. Just not TickTick. UPDATE: Tech support hung in there with me and resolved my issue. Thanks!!!
18.Hi, TickTick is wonderful and I use it daily as a free user. Its support team will respond to our messages, ASAP. Thank you, TickTick team.
19.Finally! A fully functional task list that completely integrates your day and is actually a reasonable price. It has all of the necessary features including categories (called tags), separate lists, notes, calendar integration, email integration, sync across platforms and probably most important; you can view your tasks in many different ways so they do not become overwhelming. We all have a huge list of to do's but, TickTick will help you organize them and view them in a useful way!
20.Just when I think it can't get any better! I have used so many organizing apps and this one is head and shoulders above the rest. With other apps whenever they make an update you're groaning hoping nothing breaks and this app it's always an improvement you didn't even think about. I have made multiple suggestions and 90% of the time they are actually implemented within a few months. It literally has everything you need without being overwhelming.
